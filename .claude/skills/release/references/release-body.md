This is the body that lands on `https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/gemini-voyager/releases/tag/v{VERSION}`. It's **derivative of the in-product changelog** (`src/pages/content/changelog/notes/{VERSION}.md`) but reformatted for a developer audience:

- Two languages (English + 简体中文), rendered as **separate sections** — not mixed per cell.
- Table format with PR/commit attribution in a third column.
- Skips `zh_TW`, `ja`, `fr`, etc. (those live in the in-product changelog).

## Why this exists as a separate artifact from the in-product changelog

| Audience | File | Format |
|---|---|---|
| End users (in-product) | `src/pages/content/changelog/notes/{VERSION}.md` | 10 locales, bullet lists |
| Developers (GitHub release page) | posted via `gh release edit --notes-file` | en + zh, tables with PR/commit attribution |

The workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) generates a default body on tag push using `gh api releases/generate-notes`. The default has contributor attribution but is **not** the curated table. After the workflow finishes, overwrite the body with this template.

## Layout principle — EN visible, ZH collapsed

Two prior iterations didn't work:

1. **Mixed-cell EN+ZH** (e.g. `**Feature name** 功能名 | Description here. 一句中文描述。`) — every reader parses 2× the text they need.
2. **EN tables stacked above ZH tables** (the 1.4.0 era) — single-language and cleaner per row, but the page doubles in vertical length and readers scroll past content they can't read.

Current layout:

- **English tables visible at the top** (the GitHub release page audience skews global; EN gets first-screen real estate).
- **Chinese section wrapped in `<details><summary><b>中文版 · Chinese</b></summary>`** so it collapses by default. ZH readers click once.
- **Drop the "Implemented in" / "实现" column when every row is `direct commit by @Nagi-ovo`** — that column is pure noise when 100% owner-attributed. Inline the `closes #NNN` reference into the description for the rare row that needs it. Add a single trailer line `_All changes by @Nagi-ovo unless noted._` (and `_除特别注明外，均由 @Nagi-ovo 提交。_` in the ZH section) below each language's tables.
- **Keep the column when external contributors landed PRs in this release** — attribution matters more than column-drop savings. Each PR row reads `PR #NNN by @author`; owner rows read `—` or are dropped to a footer note.

Shared metadata (Full Changelog URL, New Contributors) lives only once, after the collapsed ZH block.

## Full template

Two flavors — pick based on whether external contributors landed PRs in this release.

### Flavor 1 — Owner-only release (drop attribution column)

```markdown
## ✨ What's New

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **{Feature Name}** | {One-line description.} *(closes #NNN if applicable)* |
{repeat rows…}

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **{Fix Name}** | {One-line description.} |
{repeat rows…}

_All changes by @Nagi-ovo unless noted._

<details>
<summary><b>中文版 · Chinese</b></summary>

## ✨ 新功能

| 功能 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| **{功能名}** | {一句话说明。}（关联 #NNN，可选） |
{repeat rows…}

## 🐛 修复

| 修复 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| **{修复名}** | {一句话说明。} |
{repeat rows…}

_除特别注明外，均由 @Nagi-ovo 提交。_

</details>

---

## New Contributors  ← omit if none

* @{user} made their first contribution in PR #{NNN}

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/gemini-voyager/compare/v{PREV_VERSION}...v{VERSION}
```

### Flavor 2 — Mixed contributors (keep attribution column)

When external PRs landed, the column carries information worth a column. Owner rows leave a `—` rather than repeating the handle on every row.

```markdown
## ✨ What's New

| Feature | Description | By |
|---------|-------------|----|
| **{Feature Name}** | {One-line description.} | PR #{NNN} by @{author} |
| **{Owner Feature}** | {One-line description.} | — |
{repeat rows…}

(rest of the structure is identical to Flavor 1, with the matching `By` / `提交者` column in the ZH table; drop the trailer line since attribution is per-row)
```

### Wrapper notes

- `<details>` requires a **blank line after `</summary>`** for the inner Markdown headings/tables to parse. Don't omit it.
- Use `<b>` inside `<summary>` (GitHub respects HTML); `**bold**` does not render inside the summary tag.
- The `## 📥 Installation` section and the Safari block are appended by the workflow — do not duplicate them. They sit below the collapsed `<details>`, outside the wrapper.

## Generation procedure

Perform these steps after the tag push completes (see SKILL.md Step 6).

### 1. Collect data

```bash
PREV_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 v{VERSION}^)
git log ${PREV_TAG}..v{VERSION} --oneline        # authoritative list of commits for the tables
gh api repos/Nagi-ovo/gemini-voyager/releases/generate-notes \
  -f tag_name=v{VERSION} \
  -f previous_tag_name=${PREV_TAG} \
  --jq '.body'                                    # use ONLY for the New Contributors section
```

**Important:** `generate-notes` has a `"What's Changed"` section that looks like a PR list — **don't use it as your source of truth for the tables**. It filters to external-contributor PRs only; owner (`@Nagi-ovo`) PRs get silently dropped. For v1.4.0, that meant PR #616, #614, #613 (all owner PRs) didn't appear even though they're user-facing features. Always drive the tables from `git log`, where every `feat`/`fix` commit shows up with its `(#NNN)` suffix when applicable. Use `gh pr view <NNN>` to confirm authors.

### 2. Filter commits for the tables

Include:
- `feat(…): …` → **What's New** row
- `fix(…): …` → **Bug Fixes** row

Exclude:
- `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, `ci`, `build` — internal noise
- `docs` — unless the doc change is user-visible (e.g., a new settings guide linked from the product)
- Sponsor/README updates
- Commits that roll back or amend other commits within the same release window

When in doubt, ask: "Would a user care?"

### 3. Write each row

Each row appears **twice** in the final body — once in the English table, once in the Chinese table. Same PR/commit attribution in both. Keep EN and ZH rows in the same order so readers can cross-reference by position.

**Feature/Fix column** — bold title, one language per table:
```
EN:  | **Pinned timeline preview** |
ZH:  | **固定时间线预览** |
```

**Description column** — one sentence per language. Keep under ~15 words.
```
EN:  | Keep the timeline preview panel pinned from the popup. |
ZH:  | 可在弹窗中将时间线预览面板固定显示。 |
```

**Attribution** — depends on which Flavor you're using (see `Full template` above):

- **Flavor 1 (owner-only release)**: no `By` column. Inline `(closes #NNN)` / `（关联 #NNN）` into the description for rows that reference an issue. Add the trailer line `_All changes by @Nagi-ovo unless noted._` (and ZH equivalent) below each language's tables.
- **Flavor 2 (mixed contributors)**: keep the `By` / `提交者` column. External PR rows read `PR #NNN by @author`; owner rows read `—` (em-dash) so the column is uniform width without repeating the handle.

Map commit → PR by scanning commit messages for `(#NNN)` suffixes, or by running `gh pr list --state merged --search "<commit-short-sha>"`.

### 4. New Contributors

Take this section from `gh api generate-notes` output — it correctly identifies first-time contributors across repo history. Don't handwrite it; you'll miss someone. This section stays English-only (GitHub auto-generates it that way and readers of both languages recognize the pattern).

### 5. Paste together

Combine sections into `release_body.md` in this order (top to bottom):

1. `## ✨ What's New` (EN) table
2. `## 🐛 Bug Fixes` (EN) table
3. `_All changes by @Nagi-ovo unless noted._` trailer (Flavor 1) — or skip if Flavor 2
4. Open `<details><summary><b>中文版 · Chinese</b></summary>` + **blank line**
5. `## ✨ 新功能` (ZH) table
6. `## 🐛 修复` (ZH) table
7. `_除特别注明外，均由 @Nagi-ovo 提交。_` trailer (Flavor 1) — or skip if Flavor 2
8. **Blank line** + `</details>`
9. `---` divider
10. `## New Contributors` (omit entire section if the release has no new contributors — don't leave an empty heading)
11. `**Full Changelog**: …` link
12. ⚠️ Stop here. The workflow already appended the Installation block and Safari block.

### 6. Apply

```bash
gh release edit v{VERSION} --notes-file release_body.md
```

This overwrites the body. The asset list and Installation block are preserved if they live as a separate field — check `gh release view v{VERSION} --json body` immediately after and confirm the Installation section is still present. If it disappeared (because `--notes-file` replaced the entire body, including workflow-appended tail), append the Installation block manually before re-running.

**Safer alternative:** first read the current body, strip the curated sections if present (from a previous attempt), prepend the new curated sections, and write back. This preserves whatever the workflow put there:

```bash
CURRENT=$(gh release view v{VERSION} --json body --jq '.body')
# Find the line "## 📥 Installation" and keep from there onward
TAIL=$(echo "$CURRENT" | awk '/^## 📥 Installation/{flag=1} flag')
printf "%s\n\n%s" "$(cat release_body.md)" "$TAIL" > final_body.md
gh release edit v{VERSION} --notes-file final_body.md
```

## Worked example — v1.3.9 (Flavor 2: external contributors present)

Given commits in the v1.3.8..v1.3.9 range:

```
feat: pinned timeline preview (closes #570)
feat(timeline): configurable jump shortcuts (closes #568)
fix(timeline): persist node hierarchy per account
fix(folder): nested folder moves (#547)
fix(firefox): permission request handling (#567)
chore: sponsor update          ← skip
style: prettier                 ← skip
```

Two of the five commits are external PRs (#547 chang-xinhai, #567 LinJHS), so this is a Flavor 2 release — keep the `By` column and use it for attribution. Produces:

```markdown
## ✨ What's New

| Feature | Description | By |
|---------|-------------|----|
| **Pinned timeline preview** | Keep the timeline preview panel pinned from the popup. (closes #570) | — |
| **Configurable timeline jump shortcuts** | Customize the shortcut keys used to jump through the timeline. (closes #568) | — |

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

| Fix | Description | By |
|-----|-------------|----|
| **Experimental node hierarchy** | Timeline node hierarchy state now persists separately for each account. | — |
| **Nested folder moves** | Moving folders with child folders now works correctly. | PR #547 by @chang-xinhai |
| **Firefox permission flow** | Fixed permission request handling for Firefox. | PR #567 by @LinJHS |

```

## Worked example — v1.4.2 (Flavor 1: owner-only)

All commits attributable to @Nagi-ovo, so drop the `By` column entirely; `closes #NNN` moves into the description for the one row that needs it. The trailer line carries the universal attribution.

```markdown
## ✨ What's New

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Floating folder mode** *(off by default)* | Pop the folder panel out as a draggable floating window instead of injecting it into the sidebar. Toggle from popup → Folder options. |
| **AI Studio new nav support** | Folder panel now mounts on AI Studio's refreshed left nav (`/prompts` and `/library`), restoring the feature after Google's UI change. (closes #622) |
| … (rest of rows) … |

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Vim mode line editing** | Stabilized cursor behavior at end-of-line during operations. |
| **Sidebar auto-hide / full-hide independence** | The two settings are now independent — toggling one no longer affects the other. |

_All changes by @Nagi-ovo unless noted._

<summary><b>中文版 · Chinese</b></summary>

## ✨ 新功能

| 功能 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| **悬浮文件夹模式** *（默认关闭）* | 把文件夹面板拆成可拖动的悬浮窗，不再注入到侧边栏。弹窗 → 文件夹选项中开启。 |
| … (rest of rows) … |

## 🐛 修复

| 修复 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| **Vim 模式行尾编辑** | 行尾操作时光标行为更稳定。 |
| **侧边栏自动隐藏与完全隐藏独立** | 两项设置互相独立，不再相互干扰。 |

_除特别注明外，均由 @Nagi-ovo 提交。_
