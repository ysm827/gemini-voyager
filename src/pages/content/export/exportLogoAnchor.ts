// Resolves the anchor element for the inline export dropdown (Gemini's logo).

// Why this exists: the lr26 UI refresh removed `[data-test-id="logo"]` entirely
// (see persistentExportToolbar.ts). The old code waited out the full 6s + 2s
// `waitForElement` timeout for a logo that will never appear, which delayed the
// fallback persistent export toolbar by several seconds on every conversation
// load. Short-circuit to `null` immediately on the logoless layout so the
// toolbar mounts right away, while keeping the original wait for older layouts
// where the logo may mount slightly after navigation.

  // lr26 (and later) refresh removed the logo for good. Don't wait for what
  // won't come; fall straight through to the persistent-toolbar fallback.
  if (doc.body?.classList.contains('lr26')) return null;

  // Older layout where the logo may still mount post-navigation: keep waiting.
