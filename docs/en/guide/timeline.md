# Time Travel

Voyager Timeline is a visual conversation navigation system for Google Gemini. It maps every message in a chat to an interactive node on the right side of the screen, turning long AI conversations into a navigable map you can jump through instantly.

Long conversations are messy. You scroll up, you scroll down, you lose your place.
Voyager turns your conversation into a timeline.

## See the Shape of Your Chat

Look at the right side of your screen.
Each node represents a message. The timeline visualizes the rhythm of your dialogue.

## Navigation, Solved.

- **Teleport**: Click a node to jump instantly to that message.
- **Peek**: Hover to see what's inside without moving.
- **Bookmark**: Long-press a node to **Star** it. It's like a bookmark for your brain.
- **Levels (Experimental)**: Right-click a node to set various levels (1-3) or collapse children. Perfect for making branched conversations clear.
- **Resize**: Drag the inner edge of the timeline to adjust its width.
- **Keyboard**: Navigate at the speed of thought. Default `j`/`k`, `gg`/`GG` to jump to first/last turn.

## Star: Bookmark Your Breakthroughs

Long conversations bury gold. Star the moments that matter.

**How it works**: Long-press (hold ~0.5s) any node on the timeline. You'll see it light up — that message is now starred.

- Long-press again to unstar.
- Starred nodes stay highlighted so you can spot them at a glance.
- View all your starred messages from the **Starred History** panel (click the star icon in the timeline header).

Think of it as planting a flag in the conversation — the moment you had a breakthrough, got the perfect answer, or want to pick up later.

Stars sync across devices if you have [Cloud Sync](/guide/cloud-sync) enabled.

## Even Faster with Keys

Don't want to use the mouse? Use your keyboard.

**It's like turning on Vim mode in Gemini.**

### Default Shortcuts

- `k` - Jump to previous node
- `j` - Jump to next node
- `gg` - Jump to first turn
- `GG` - Jump to last turn

### Customize It

Open extension settings, click a shortcut box, press any key you want.
Any key, any combo. `n`/`p`? `,`/`.`? Your call.

**Flow mode**: Rapid presses queue up smoothly.
**Jump mode**: Instant response, max speed.

## When to Use Timeline

Timeline is most valuable in conversations longer than 10 messages, where scrolling becomes inefficient:

- **Research sessions**: You asked Gemini to explore a topic over 30+ turns. Timeline lets you jump back to the key insight without re-reading everything.
- **Code debugging**: A long debugging conversation where the solution appeared at turn 47. Star it, find it later in one click.
- **Learning and tutoring**: Working through a complex topic step by step. Use levels to collapse sections you've mastered.
- **Brainstorming review**: Reviewing a creative session to extract the best ideas. Stars mark the moments worth keeping.
- **Team handoffs**: Share a starred conversation so a colleague can jump straight to the relevant turns.

## Timeline vs. Manual Scrolling

| Capability | Without Timeline | With Voyager Timeline |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Find a specific message | Scroll up and down repeatedly | Click a node or press j/k |
| Bookmark key moments | Copy-paste to external notes | Long-press to star, syncs to cloud |
| See conversation structure | Read sequentially | Visual map shows full shape at a glance |
| Keyboard navigation | Not available in Gemini | Vim-style j/k, gg/GG, fully customizable |
| Navigate 100+ messages | Minutes of scrolling | Instant jump to any point |
| Organize long threads | No built-in tools | Levels (1-3) and collapsible children |

## Supported Browsers

Timeline works on Google Gemini across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Brave. Keyboard shortcuts, starring, and levels work identically on all platforms. Starred messages sync across devices when [Cloud Sync](/en/guide/cloud-sync) is enabled.

Timeline is a Gemini-exclusive feature and is not available on AI Studio, where conversations tend to be shorter.
